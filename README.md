# NYPD Arrests Analysis
 The NYPD Arrests (Historic) dataset is used to answer some interesting questions about arrests by the NYPD from 2015 to 2018.
In this directory, that are many files of interest and some that are not shown here. The data file can be found [HERE](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u). There is a R Markdown document and HTML file for the process of validating and cleaning the data. (The PDF of the output is not uploaded due to the large size of the file, presumably due to the nice map at the end.) Running this Rmd file will create a cleaned dataset for analysis for the latter part of this project. There are 3 files for the analysis of the data set. One is a R Markdown file showing all the code, the second is a PDF output of the analysis (the *deliverable*) and third is a HTML file. 

Also included in this repository is a R Shiny application that shows four interactive visualizations. This is a proof of concept and a work in progress. There is also the shapefile of the New York Police Department precincts, that is used for validating the data and creating maps. (Source: [NYC Planning - Open Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page).) Lastly, the logo for the NYPD is uploaded here for use in all the visualizations in the report.
